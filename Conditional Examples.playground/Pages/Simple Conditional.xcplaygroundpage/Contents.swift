 ## If
 ### Simplest form
 In it's simplest form, an *if* statement tests a single condition.
 
 When that condition is *true*, a block of statement(s) is run.
 
 For example:
 */
let hairColour = getRandomHairColour()
print("The hair colour generated was: \(hairColour)")

if hairColour == "red" {
    print("My goodness, how handsome!")
}
