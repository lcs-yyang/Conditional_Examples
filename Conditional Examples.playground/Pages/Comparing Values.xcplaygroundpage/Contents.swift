 ### Comparison operators
 
 There are many ways to compare values with conditional statements.
 
 * Equal to (a == b)
 * Not equal to (a != b)
 * Greater than (a > b)
 * Less than (a < b)
 * Greater than or equal to (a >= b)
 * Less than or equal to (a <= b)

// What did we get?
print("a is: \(a)")
print("b is: \(b)")

// Does a equal b?
if a == b {
    print("a equals b")
}

// Does a not equal b?
if a != b {
    print("a is not equal to b")
}

// Is a greater than b?
if a > b {
    print("a is greater than b")
}

// Is a less than than b?
if a < b {
    print("a is less than b")
}

// Is a greater than or equal to b?
if a >= b {
    print("a is greater than or equal to b")
}

// Is a less than or equal to b?
if a <= b {
    print("a is less than or equal to b")
